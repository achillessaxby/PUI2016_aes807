Hey Nicola.

The plot looks great !!
The data you wanted to interpret and the plot shows the different boroughs and the distribution in each is perfectly clear.

The only aspect of your plot that needs a little bit of editing is the one huge plot itself - it would have been better to show the distribtions of the boroughs in a separate plot altogeather.

The first two plots need not have combined and even if they were combined - the legend should have been seperate because it gets confusing when the legend has the markings of two different plots togeather.
