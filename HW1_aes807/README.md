Using the directions given in the NYU Classes and the Assignments, following them and collaborating with the team mentioned above, I have created two repositories in GitHub(achillessaxby)
    - gittest_achilles - Laboratory1
    - PUI2016_aes807 - HW1 - Assignments 1 & 2

Also, using the fork/clone/merge directions - everything completed successfully in github - with gittest_dfay_repo with Daniel Fay - merged with Daniel and can be seen on repo - achillessaxby.

All the files and screenshots have been taken and stored in the Jupyter notebooks under the /homedirs/aes807/PUI2016 folder.
