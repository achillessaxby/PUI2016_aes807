## Assignment:

### a. verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly

#### Older People Duration is likely shorter than the duration of younder people.

The null and alternative hypothesis are correctly formatted.
The idea is that the quantification of the amount of people who are considered older (or rather born before 1970)
take shorter riding trips than the younger people (born after 1970) - in this case the Null and Alternate Hypothesis
have been formulated spot on.

However, the data is only able to verify whether there is or isn't a difference in mean time of ride, but does not reflect the reasoning. 
Some other ideas of anomalies may exist:  which is not accounted for but that does not matter since the end result is perfect.
-- Older subscribers may ride for a shorter length of time because they know where they are going and they just use this as
a recreational purpose.
-- Some older people might be riding everyday so that they stay fit and healthy so shorter rides since they do not have to
go to work or such might be the case as well.
-- Younger people might want to ride all around to see things and many other factors that can be used to assess this data set that you have created which does not matter again because you have given the perfect formulations 

### b. verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test has not been chosen yet)

The data has the appropriate variables and has been successfully processed to remove all but the trip duration, birth year and gender year so that other data sets can be created from these factors. 
The fact that you have chosen the gender and given it a 1 or a 2 and the years that can be subtracted shows that there are amny things that can be done with just these two datasets and sicne you have dropped everything else other than these two - it looks to be the best choice.
Also, making age groups to sort out the customers in for a better quality data set and bins is an innovational idea.
#### the data supports the project and it has been properly pre-processed for other extractions.


### c. Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. 
#### You can refer to the flowchart of statistical tests for this in the slides, or to the CSU cheat-sheet here, of Statistics in a Nutshell.

A t-test would be appropriate for this hypothesis as the independent variable is dichotomous (subscriber or customer) 
and there is one dependent variable (duration of ride is continous).
