## Assignment 2:

### Part - I (Choosing two from the First Half of the Table to use as a guideline)

#### Statistical Analysis done on a paper published that involved both MANCOVA and ANCOVA tests - so I thought it would be best to use this paper so that I can get exposed and learn about how both can be used simultaneously and how two different tests are clubbed togeather to show a single result.
